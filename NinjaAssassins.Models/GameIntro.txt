Once upon a time there was a peaceful place, where leaved very 

well trained ninjas. But some of them become evil and started 

to kill innocent gamers. They become Ninja Assassins. The good
 
ninjas - Nick, Doni, Ivo and E.C. swore to help the gamers. We 

called them the Green Ninjas. Unfortunately they can`t save 

everyone and the gamers must help themselves... 



	 	  	ONLY ONE SURVIVES. 

		   ONLY ONE IS THE LUCKY WINNER!
